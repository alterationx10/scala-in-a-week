Scala In A Week
===============

## Still currently a work in progress!

An example project showing that Scala isn't some scary language, and that
any team can pick it up quickly!

There is an example TypeScript webapp project, and [will be] a corresponding Scala one
to show how straight forward it can be to make the swap.

There will be a corresponding set of blog posts to walk throught the porting process,
paced at a 'Days worth' of concepts to get you comfortable with making the switch
by the end of this week ;-)

[Tentantive Schedule]

## Day 0 - Understanding the current stack
## Day 1 - Project set up and configuration
## Day 2 - Setting up a webserver using Akka HTTP
